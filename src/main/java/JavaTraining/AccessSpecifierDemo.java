//Access Specifiers: 
//Access specifier indicates where all a class member is accessible
//There are four access specifiers in java
//1.private 
//private members can be accessed only within the class

//2.public
//public members can be accessed within the class, from other classes, 
//other packages also

//3.protected
//protected is related to inheritance

//4.none(or default)
//members with no access specifier, can be accessed within the class, from other classes
//and only within current package

//Access specifiers can be used with data members, member methods, and constructors
